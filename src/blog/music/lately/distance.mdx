Hey love time to get up  
I think you’ve been sleeping too long  
My day started when you were still yawning  
One room just ain’t enough  
When it’s two folks trying to get along  
But it’s hard to leave you alone

Oh love is always better  
When we take time to get back to who we are  
When we are apart  
Distance makes the heart grow  
Even when I’m lonely  
Happy knowing that your love is never far  
When we are apart  
Distance makes the heart

It makes the leaves on the trees fall  
It makes the hours in the day long  
Makes me wanna clear my head  
Find a little cafe and write the words to a song  
And I know that I’m still free  
Be anywhere that I wanna be  
Maybe get dressed up  
Wear something real pretty that you ain’t never seen

Oh love is always better  
When we take time to get back to who we are  
When we are apart  
Distance makes the heart grow  
Even when I’m lonely  
Happy knowing that your love is never far  
When we are apart  
Distance makes the..

When you love it makes the heart  
When you trust it makes the heart  
When you call it makes it heart  
We’re alone, when we’re apart  
In the middle of a fight  
Walk away to make it right  
Where we go we’re never far  
In the light or in the dark  
On a plane up in the stars  
In a movie or at the bar  
Home alone or out to tea  
Look to your heart and think of me  
I wanna love you  
Don’t wanna try to change the pace of your life  
We get together we make it good  
We get together, ooh..

Hey love time to get up  
I think you’ve been sleeping too long  
My day started when you were still yawning
