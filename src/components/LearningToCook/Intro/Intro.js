      One of my favorite parts of learning is sharing. As I've been working
      towards becoming a culinarian, I've noticed that food preparation has a
      lot of similarities with web development: there's much to learn from your
      predecessors, and the goal is to share your creation. In both, some of my
      creations are awesome, and some suck, but I'm learning and that's what
      keeps me happy.
