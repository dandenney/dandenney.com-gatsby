Do you hear me?  
Talking to you  
across the water  
across the deep blue ocean  
under the open sky  
oh my, baby im trying

boy i hear you in my dreams  
i feel your whisper across the sea  
i keep you with me in my heart  
you make it easier when life gets hard

lucky im in love with my best friend  
lucky to have been where i have been  
lucky to be coming home again  
ohhhohhhohhhohhohhohhhohh

they dont know how long it takes  
waiting for a love like this  
every time we say goodbye  
i wish we had one more kiss  
ill wait for you, i promise you i will

lucky im in love with my best friend  
lucky to have been where i have been  
lucky to be coming home again  
lucky were in love in every way

lucky to have stayed where we have stayed  
lucky to be coming home someday

and so im sailing through the sea  
to an island where well meet  
youll hear the music fill the air  
ill put a flower in your hair

though the breezes through the trees  
move so pretty, youre all i see  
as the world keeps spinning round  
you hold me right here right now

lucky im in love with my best friend  
lucky to have been where i have been  
lucky to be coming home again  
lucky were in love in every way  
lucky to have stayed where we have stayed  
lucky to be coming home someday  
ohhhohhhohhhohhohhohhhohh  
ohhhohhhohhhohhohhohhhohhohhohhohh  
uuuuuuuuuuh  
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh  
uuuuuuuuuuuuh
