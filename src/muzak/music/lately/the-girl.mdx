thought: 'I could probably add nearly every City and Colour song, his voice is so beautiful. This song is so simple and yet so full of love.'

I wish I could do better by you  
Cause that's what you deserve  
You sacrifice so much of your life  
In order for this to work

While I'm off chasing my own dreams  
Sailing around the world  
Please know that I'm yours to keep  
My beautiful girl

When you cry a piece of my heart dies  
Knowing that I may have been the cause  
If you were to leave  
Fulfill someone else's dreams  
I think I might totally be lost

You don't ask for no diamond rings  
No delicate string of pearls  
That's why I wrote this song to sing  
My beautiful girl

Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh  
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh  
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh  
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh

I wish I could do better by you

My beautiful girl

And when you cry a piece of my heart dies  
Knowing that I may have been the cause  
If you were to leave  
Fulfill someone else's dreams  
I think I might totally be lost

But you don't ask for no diamond rings (diamond rings)  
No delicate string of pearls (string of pearls)  
That's why I wrote this song to sing  
My beautiful girl

Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh  
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh  
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh  
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
