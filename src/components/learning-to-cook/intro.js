    <h1>Learning to Cook</h1>
    <p>
      One of my favorite parts of learning is sharing. As I've been working
      towards becoming a culinarian, I've noticed that food preparation has a
      lot of similarities with web development: you learn the techniques of the
      craft to create something, there's much to learn from your predecessors,
      and the goal is to share your creation. In both, some of my creations are
      awesome, and some suck, but I'm learning and that's what keeps me happy.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I'll share journal-type posts of small experiments, techniques, etc.
      and longer-form recipes that I've found somewhere and made my own.
