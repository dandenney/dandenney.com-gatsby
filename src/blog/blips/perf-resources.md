Andy had this tweet that got some great responses:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Pals ðŸ‘‹<br /><br />I *really* want to get into web perf. I&#39;ve got fundamental, scrappy knowledge, but I want to really deep dive and learn the heck out of it.<br /><br />Whoâ€™s good to follow? Whoâ€™s writing good stuff?<br /><br />Also, courses/tutorial series recommendations would be greatly appreciated ðŸš€</p>&mdash; Andy Bell ðŸŒ¹ (@hankchizljaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw/status/1193606108121837568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I was going to make a list of the resources, but he did that too, [web perf resources](https://www.notion.so/0ff36fef08f640ef9085103839bac372?v=6383913289ee4a2b8e87542cab06b1ca).
