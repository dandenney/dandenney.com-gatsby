thought: 'This one goes out to my ride or die. On the music side, it has this cool vibe and a mix of darkness and hope.'

You say "I love you, boy"  
I know you lie  
I trust you all the same  
I don't know why

Cause when my back is turned  
My bruises shine  
Our broken fairytale  
So hard to hide

**I still believe it's you and me 'til the end of time**

When we collide we come together  
If we don't we'll always be apart  
I'll take a bruise; I know you're worth it  
When you hit me hit me hard

Sitting in a wishing hole  
Hoping it stays dry  
Feet cast in solid stone  
I've got Gilligan's eyes

**I still believe it's you and me 'til the end of time**

When we collide we come together  
If we don't we'll always be apart  
I'll take a bruise; I know you're worth it  
When you hit me hit me hard

You said love was letting us go against what  
Our future is for...  
Many of horror  
Our future's for many of horror

**I still believe it's you and me 'til the end of time**

When we collide we come together  
If we don't we'll always be apart  
I'll take a bruise; I know you're worth it  
When you hit me hit me hard
